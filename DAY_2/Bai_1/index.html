    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>
      This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called
      <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the
      food(usually cacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele
      set to target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
      <em>Cooking fir Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low
      temperature poaching".

      <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.To reserve a seat ar the
      chef table, contact us before November 30.
